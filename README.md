# 🛍️ Retail Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview

This project performs **Customer Segmentation** on retail transaction data using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchase behavior to support targeted marketing and improve customer retention strategies.

The analysis uses a real-world online retail dataset and demonstrates how to:

- 📊 Calculate RFM metrics for each customer  
- 🏷️ Score and segment customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary value  
- 📈 Visualize RFM score distributions  
- ⭐ Identify best customers and potential segments for personalized engagement

## 📂 Dataset

- The dataset contains transaction records of an online retail store.  
- Key columns include: `Customer ID`, `InvoiceDate`, `Invoice`, `Quantity`, and `Price`.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks containing data exploration, RFM calculation, scoring, and visualization  
- `data/` — Raw and processed dataset files  
- `rfm_scores.csv` — Output file with calculated RFM scores and segments

## 🔑 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
   Convert dates, calculate total price per transaction, handle missing values.

2. **RFM Calculation:**  
   Aggregate data per customer to calculate recency (days since last purchase), frequency (number of purchases), and monetary value (total spending).

3. **RFM Scoring:**  
   Assign scores (1-5) for each RFM metric based on quintiles, where a higher score indicates better customer value.

4. **Segmentation & Visualization:**  
   Combine scores to form customer segments and visualize the distribution of RFM scores.
